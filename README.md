# typescript

Typescript is a development tool which is a wrapper around javascript just to make it more efficient.

`TYPE SAFETY` For `javascript`

`Static Checking` - IDE points out the error in the first place.

`ts` fies are converted(transpiled) into `js` and then executed.

## Types in typescript

Numbers
String
Boolean
Array
Tuples
`ANY` -> Not to be Used

## Situations 

Typechecking in the first place to minimize error and max optimization
1. Function to add 2 numbers.
2. Function which should Return a string.

We dont have to write an extra check to validate the input and output
